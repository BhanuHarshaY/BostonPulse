# BostonPulse

Real-time Boston city intelligence powered by the [Subconscious](https://subconscious.dev) agent platform. Ask anything about Boston: transit, weather, events, what's happening tonight,  and get a live, synthesized answer pulled from the MBTA API, OpenWeatherMap, Ticketmaster, Reddit, and real-time web/tweet search.

## UI

BostonPulse features a three-panel real-time interface built with Next.js 15 and React 19:

| Panel | What it shows |
|-------|--------------|
| **Live Sidebar** (left) | Real-time MBTA transit alerts, current weather, today's events, and city buzz from Reddit — auto-refreshes every 2 minutes |
| **Chat** (center) | Conversational interface with streaming AI responses rendered as markdown, conversation history, and quick-action suggestion cards |
| **Reasoning Panel** (right) | Live visibility into the agent's thinking process — reasoning steps, tool invocations with parameters/results, and a tools summary timeline |

**Design highlights:**
- Dark glassmorphism theme with translucent surfaces and backdrop blur
- Real-time streaming with typing indicators and animated reasoning timeline
- Collapsible sidebars with smooth transitions — toggle from the header
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- MBTA line-colored transit alerts (Red, Orange, Green, Blue, Silver)
- Skeleton loading states while data is being fetched

## What it does

BostonPulse pre-fetches live data from four sources before the agent runs, then passes it as context in the prompt so the agent can synthesize a concise answer immediately:

| Data source | What it provides |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **MBTA API v3** | Live transit alerts — delays, closures, service changes across subway, bus, and commuter rail |
| **OpenWeatherMap** | Current Boston conditions — temperature, wind, humidity, rain |
| **Ticketmaster** | Today's events — games, concerts, shows in the Boston area |
| **Reddit r/boston** | City buzz — trending community posts, local discussions |

The agent also has access to Subconscious platform tools (`tweet_search`, `fresh_search`, `web_search`, `news_search`) to pull in real-time social chatter and breaking local news.

Responses are formatted as structured markdown with emoji section headers, rendered in the UI via `react-markdown`.

## Architecture

Live data is fetched **server-side** in the Next.js API route before calling the agent — not as function-tool callbacks. This means the app works without a public tunnel URL and deploys cleanly to Vercel with no networking complexity.

## Local development

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd BostonPulse
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and fill in all three API keys (see below), then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm run dev` starts a [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) automatically so the Subconscious platform can reach any self-hosted tools. If you only need platform tools (the default), you can skip it:

```bash
npm run dev:no-tunnel
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Where to get it |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `SUBCONSCIOUS_API_KEY` | **Yes** | [subconscious.dev/platform](https://subconscious.dev/platform) |
| `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` | **Yes** | [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api) — free tier, key activates within 2 hours |
| `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` | **Yes** | [developer.ticketmaster.com](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/) — free, instant |
| `SUBCONSCIOUS_ENGINE` | No | Default: `tim-gpt`. Options: `tim`, `tim-edge`, `tim-gpt-heavy` |

Without `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` or `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`, the agent will fall back to using `web_search` to find that data. The MBTA feed is public and requires no key.

## Engines

| Engine | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| `tim-gpt` | Default — good balance of speed and quality |
| `tim-edge` | Fastest responses |
| `tim-gpt-heavy` | Most thorough reasoning |

## Adding data sources

To add a new live data source (e.g. Red Sox schedule, parking availability):

1. Add a fetch function in `lib/boston-data.ts`
2. Call it inside `fetchAllBostonData()` alongside the existing `Promise.all`
3. Extend the `BostonLiveData` interface and add it to the context block in `buildLiveDataBlock()` in `lib/types.ts`
4. Update the system prompt in `lib/types.ts` to tell the agent the new data is available

No tool registration needed — data is injected as context, not fetched by the agent.
